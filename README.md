## Aggregating data at nodes
Ok so we have nodes, and each 
A nice alternative for next time could be to have an hex grid, nice geometric advantages.   
Cannot convert our regular grid to hexagonal grid because nodes are in a regular grid, hexagonal requires offset at alternate rows.   

Grid is obviously not aligned to a regular latitude longitude grid as distance between nodes would decrease moving away from the equator.

For each node a square with a small rotation was created.   The squares were uploaded to Google Earth Engine for part of the process.   



### Forest area and forest categories   
Italy is divided into regions and each region into provinces. We have a full cover of forest categories of two regions, Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia, and the province of Trento.   Categories slightly differ in classification, but discrepancies were merged into a single catogory.
